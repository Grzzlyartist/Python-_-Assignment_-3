# Descrption of the Program

. Function Definition: The function calculate_discount checks if the discount_percent is 20% or higher.

. Discount Calculation: If the discount is applicable, it calculates the discount amount by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage (converted from a percentage to a 
  decimal). The discount amount is subtracted from the original price to get the final price.

. Return Original Price: If the discount is less than 20%, the function returns the original price without any discount.

. User Inputs: The program prompts the user to enter the original price and the discount percentage. These inputs are converted to floating-point numbers for accurate calculations.

. Function Call: The function is called with the user-provided values, and the result is stored in final_price.

. Output: The final price is printed formatted to two decimal places to ensure it represents a standard monetary value.
